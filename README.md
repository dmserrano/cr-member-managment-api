# CR Member Management API

This project is the API for dmserrano/cr-member-management. It's main purpose is to communicate with the Clash Royale developer API to provide clan participation data to the front end application.

## Usage

To run this project locally you would need to create an account with [Clash Royale API](https://developer.clashroyale.com/) and add your API token to a local `.env` file (there is an example `.env.example` in the root of the project).

Once that is done, clone down the repo, install dependencies and start the application.
```
git clone https://github.com/dmserrano/cr-member-managment-api.git
cd cr-member-management-api
npm install
npm run dev
```
